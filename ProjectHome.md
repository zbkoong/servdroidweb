ServDroid is an small web server for the Android platforms.

  * Auto start options
  * Can run under port 1024 (iptables and super user rights are required)
  * Only serves HTML pages (Servlets implementations will be considered for in future versions).
  * Log of all requests are saved in the Android database. This information can be dumped to a text file.
  * ServDroid can be configured to vibrate when a request is received.
  * The 404 error page can be personalised.

Available on [Android Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.servDroid.web&hl=en)

The version 0.2.4 and above allows the developer to manage the ServDroid service from an other application. [Here](http://code.google.com/p/servdroidweb/wiki/How_to_bind_servDroid_service) you will find a little tutorial explaining the few steps needed to bind the service.
